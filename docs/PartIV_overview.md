# Part IV ‚Äì Training and Fine-Tuning

> *‚ÄúYou‚Äôve built the network. Now comes the real challenge: teaching it to learn‚Äîeffectively, efficiently, and without forgetting what matters.‚Äù*

---

## Why This Part Matters

A perfectly constructed CNN is useless if it doesn't learn well. Training isn't just running `.fit()` or looping over epochs. It's about:

* Choosing the right **loss function**
* Controlling how weights update via **optimizers**
* Avoiding overfitting with **regularization**
* Implementing custom **training loops**
* Knowing **when to stop**, **what to freeze**, and **what to adapt**

This part shows you how to go beyond ‚Äútraining for accuracy‚Äù and start training for **robust generalization**.

---

## What You‚Äôll Master in This Part

* Understand how backpropagation, loss gradients, and weight updates work
* Master PyTorch and TensorFlow training loop mechanics
* Apply strategies like early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and layer freezing
* Fine-tune pretrained CNNs on your own datasets
* Identify signs of **underfitting**, **overfitting**, or **data imbalance**

This part is where you gain control over **how learning happens.**

| **16**  | *Train vs Eval Mode*                                  | Why dropout and batch norm behave differently in train vs eval mode, and how to handle inference correctly     |
| **17**  | *Visualizing Feature Maps and Filters*                | How to peek inside your CNN during and after training using hooks or submodels to visualize what it "sees"     |

## üí° Key Ideas That Tie This Part Together

1. **Training is not automatic‚Äîit‚Äôs a guided process.**

   * Model quality depends on data quality, learning rate, loss signals, and architecture alignment.

2. **Overfitting is easy. Generalization is art.**

   * Preventing a model from memorizing training data is harder than most beginners realize. Augmentation and regularization are essential.

3. **Pretrained models need care.**

   * You can‚Äôt just throw new data at them‚Äîlayers must be frozen/unfrozen with purpose, and inputs must be matched.

## What You‚Äôll Be Able To Do After This Part

* Train CNNs from scratch with effective optimizers
* Implement reproducible training pipelines with logging and saving
* Debug training failures by inspecting loss curves and gradients
* Fine-tune ImageNet models for your custom use cases (e.g., cats vs dogs, X-rays vs MRI)
* Visualize how a model ‚Äúactivates‚Äù for different parts of an image
